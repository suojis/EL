# Project 3: Setup Load Balancing for Static Website Using Nignx

The project involves setting up a Layer 7 load balancer using Nginx to distribute traffic between two static websites.

**Key Tasks:** Deploy three servers, set up static websites on two servers, configure Nginx on the third server as a load balancer, and update DNS records.
